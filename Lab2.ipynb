    "Your code and discussion must be completed in this **jupyter notebook** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Lab 2 Assignment. Submit your assignment in a **zip file**, with all the relevant files and images need to run your notebook. Name your zip file as follows:  **StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.zip**\n",
    "For full credit, make sure you follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you use the provided python environment. You can create the environment using conda and the provided YAML file using the following command: `conda env create --file=CV1_env.yaml`, then activate it as `conda activate cv1`. Using different packages versions may result in the impossibility to run the submitted code and therefore in the subtraction of points. Below you will find a code cell to check the versions of your packages. \n",
    "- Please express your thoughts concisely. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Answer all given questions.\n",
    "- Try to understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, give evidences (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, figures etc.) to support your arguments. Note that not everything might be explicitly asked for and you are expected to think about what might strengthen you arguments and make your notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Analyze your results and discuss them, e.g. why algorithm A works better than algorithm B in a certain problem.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a brief description. Do not forget to add a number, a title, and if applicable name and unit of variables in a table, name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "- Make sure all the code in your notebook runs without errors or bugs before submitting. Code that does not run can result in a lower grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "Late submissions are not allowed. Assignments that are submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance, to avoid last minute system failure issues.\n",
    "Plagiarism note: Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious crime and any misconduct shall be punished with the university regulations."

    "Neighborhood processing is simply about looking around a point $I(x, y)$ (i.e. pixel) in the image, $I$, and applying a function, $h(k, l)$, which measures certain properties or relationships between the pixels in that localized window. The function, $h(k, l)$, is generally referred to as the neighborhood operator or local operator. One of the most common forms of a neighborhood operator is a linear filter. Linear filters simply compute the weighted sum of neighboring pixel intensities and assign it to the pixel of interest (output $I_{out}(i, j)$). The filters in which we are interested here are usually represented as a square matrix.\n",

With salt and pepper noise some pixels will either turn black or white, so have a pixel value of either 0 or 1. When using a box filter we take the average of the pixel surrounding, and this black or white pixel will influence the average heavily as it differs greatly from the surrounding values. Therefore the new value of the black or white pixel will still deviate from the values of the surrounding values and also the original value of the pixel. The median filter, uses the median value of its surrounding pixels as the new value for the black or white pixel. The new pixel value will be closer to the original in this way than when using the box filter since the median value is used and the black or white pixel 'replaced' instead of averaged with its surrounding pixel values."

In this exercise, you will implement a simple unsupervised algorithm that leverages the variations in texture to segment the foreground object from the background. We will assume the foreground object has a distinct combination of textures compared to background. As mentioned earlier, Gabor filters are well-suited for texture analysis thanks to their frequency domain characteristics. Therefore, we will use a collection of Gabor filters with varying scale and orientations which we call a *filter bank*. The outline of the algorithm is as follows:"
